## Gem Hunter
This is a short minigame dungeon crawler, where the player is a dinosour and has to beat different minigames to reach the final room that is filled with gold. The game was built within the [Unity](https://unity.com/) over the course of two months. 

## Motivation
This game was the final project for my intro to game programming course.
